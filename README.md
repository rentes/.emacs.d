# .emacs.d

This is my emacs configuration.
The purpose of this repository is to serve as a basis for new users to try and use the rich set of functionality Emacs provides.
Every option set in my emacs configuration has a comment to explain what it does and why it is important for my workflow. If you don't want to use a particular option, just comment it and reload your emacs configuration (by issuing M-x eval-buffer) or restart your emacs.

Have fun!
